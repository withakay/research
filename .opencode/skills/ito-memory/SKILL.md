description: Use Ito's configured memory provider to capture, search, and query project knowledge. Activate when users ask to remember, recall, search memory, query memory, save learnings, or use Ito memory. Provider-agnostic: routes through `ito agent instruction memory-capture`, `memory-search`, and `memory-query` rather than calling ByteRover or another backend directly.

# Ito Memory

Use this skill when you need to work with Ito's configured agent memory provider.

Ito memory has three operations:

- `capture`: store durable knowledge from the current work.
- `search`: retrieve ranked matching memory entries.
- `query`: ask for a synthesized answer from memory.

Do not call a concrete provider directly unless the rendered instruction tells you to. The project may use ByteRover, a markdown-backed skill, a command, or no provider at all.

## Capture

Capture only durable knowledge that should help future sessions: decisions, rationale, gotchas, recurring patterns, architecture rules, or important workflow discoveries.

```bash
ito agent instruction memory-capture \
  --context "<one-paragraph memory>" \
  --file <path> \
  --folder <path>
```

- `--context` is the memory summary.
- `--file` is repeatable and should point to supporting files.
- `--folder` is repeatable and should point to supporting folders.

Run the command printed by Ito, or invoke the skill named by Ito if the project uses a skill-backed provider.

## Search

Use search when you need likely matching memory entries or paths before reading source files.

```bash
ito agent instruction memory-search --query "<terms>" --limit 10
```

Use `--scope <scope>` when the project documents scoped memory and the query should be narrowed.

## Query

Use query when you need a synthesized answer from memory before doing broader exploration.

```bash
ito agent instruction memory-query --query "<question>"
```

Treat memory as guidance, not the source of truth. If memory conflicts with specs, code, or current instructions, trust the current source and consider capturing the correction.

## Provider Not Configured

If Ito reports that an operation is not configured, do not fail the user request. Continue with normal repo inspection and mention that Ito memory is not configured for that operation.

## Good Captures

- Why a design decision was made.
- Non-obvious commands or setup required to work in this repo.
- A bug pattern and its verified fix.
- A convention that future agents are likely to miss.

## Avoid Capturing

- Short-lived chat state.
- Secrets or credentials.
- Raw command output with no durable lesson.
- Information already captured unchanged in nearby specs or docs.
