Run the CLI-generated apply instructions for a specific change.

**Steps**

1. Determine the target change ID.

   - If the user provides one, use it.
   - Otherwise run `ito list --ready` to see changes ready for implementation.
   - Ask the user which change to apply if multiple are ready.

2. Generate instructions (source of truth):
   ```bash
   ito agent instruction apply --change "<change-id>"
   ```

3. Follow the printed instructions exactly.

4. Use `ito tasks ready <change-id>` to see actionable tasks at any point.
